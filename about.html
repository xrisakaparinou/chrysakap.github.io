                <h1>About Me </h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Chrysa Kaparinou — a software developer based in Thessaloniki with a background in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and creating tools that make a difference.</p>
  
                <p>My academic journey led me to explore both software and hardware, and my MSc thesis focused on building a 2-DOF haptic mechanism — a hands-on project that deepened my understanding of mechanical systems and interactive software design.</p>
                
                <p>I'm especially interested in backend development, cloud technologies, and automation. I enjoy working on real-world challenges, learning new frameworks, and collaborating with others to build smart, scalable solutions.</p>
                
                <p>Outside of code, I love experimenting with side projects, diving into new skills, and constantly evolving both personally and professionally.</p>
